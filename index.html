    <h2>Thoughts on Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Web accessibility is defined as websites and web tools that are properly designed to let people with disabilities navigate a site without problems. Not only does web accessibility benefit people with disabilities, but also mobile device usability, slower internet connections/limited bandwidth, or people who have environmental accessibility challenges like bright sunlight, or who cannot use audio due to their environment.</p>
    <p>Making your websites accessible is an ethical responsibility one has as a developer, but it's also a legal one. There are countries that have put in place laws to help ensure the web is developed in such a way to give everybody equal access. In America, there is the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, WCAG, which provide standards for making websites accessible.</p>
    <p>Web accessibility is not only beneficial to users, but also brings benefits to the developers in the form of a wider audience and reach. SEO is a big part of web accessibility. As a developer, you want people to use what you create; they can only do that if they can find it. Web accessibility makes it easier on the search engines to index information on a website, thereby making it easier to find.</p>

    <h3>Best Practices:</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Semantic HTML</dt>
      <dd>Applying appropriate HTML elements guarantees that screen readers will read the correct structure of the page.</dd>
      <dt>Keyboard Navigation
      <dt>
      <dd>The website should be navigational by keyboard for those people who can't operate the mouse.</dd>
      <dt>Alt Text for Images</dt>
      <dd>Providing alternate text allows a person with visual disability to know the content of the images.</dd>
      <dt>Color Contrast</dt>
      <dd>Proper color contrast makes the content readable for users having various types of visual impairments, due to color blindness.</dd>
      <dt>Responstive Design</dt>
      <dd>Making a website responsive and flexible ensure access to a range of user environments.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p><em>Our present physical world is highly dependent on our digital world. Web accessibility is an operational factor that makes our digital world more accessible and usable to every individual.</em></p>

    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is a web development approach that prioritizes content accessibility for all users, regardless of their browser, device, or assistive technology. It is unlike its counterpart, graceful degradation, which starts with the most advanced browsers and then scales back for older ones. Instead, progressive enhancement begins with a core foundation of content marked up in semantic HTML. This content is the base layer and users who can’t handle additional layers, like older browsers or mobile devices, can still access this core content. </p>
    <h3>Importance of Progressive Enhancement:</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Inclusivity and accessibility</dt>
      <dd>It ensures that all users have access to the core content regardless of their browsing capabilities. This is important in today’s diverse web landscape and various devices and browsers.</dd>
      <dt>Content Focused<dt>
      <dd>By starting with content, progressive enhancement ensures that websites primary purpose is fulfilled even without advanced features.</dd>
      <dt>Maintainability</dt>
      <dd>Separating content, presentation, and behavior (HTML, CSS, and JS) makes the website easier to maintain and update.</dd>
      <dt>Futureproofing</dt>
      <dd>Websites built with progressive enhancement are more likely to work well with future technologies as the core content is always accessible.</dd>

    <h2>Final Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <p>Creating the Dragon SpaceX mock website was a valuable learning experience. I have come to realize that the key element in website development is the workflow. The initial stages were quite challenging as I struggled to determine how to begin. However, once I established the main index.html document, I was able to progress through the other pages more efficiently.</p><p>The revision process was significantly simpler than the original, and I believe the final product exceeded my initial vision. I sought feedback from my spouse and sister, who highlighted concerns regarding readability. The font style, color, and size were contributing factors to these issues. To address this, I opted to bold and enlarge the text on the main part of the website while retaining the original font style I had chosen. Additionally, on the history page, it was mentioned that the smaller images hindered viewers from fully appreciating the details of the diagrams. To remedy this, I linked the images to larger versions, allowing viewers to examine the intricate details more closely. Furthermore, I noticed that the articles featuring photos on the home page appeared small and clustered together. Drawing inspiration from the photo carousel exercise we practiced in class; I decided to organize the articles and their accompanying photos into a carousel format.</p><p>Overall, this project has effectively integrated the knowledge I have gained this semester, and I believe it serves as a far more effective assessment of understanding than any exam could provide. Thank you for providing such an engaging learning experience! It made the classwork enjoyable and easy to understand.</p>
