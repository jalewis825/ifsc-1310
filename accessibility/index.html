      <h2>What is Web Accessibility?</h2>
      <p>Web accessibility is defined as websites and web tools that are properly designed to let people with disabilities navigate a site without problems. Not only does web accessibility benefit people with disabilities, but also mobile device usability, slower internet connections/limited bandwidth, or people who have environmental accessibility challenges like bright sunlight, or who cannot use audio due to their environment.</p>
      <p>Making your websites accessible is an ethical responsibility one has as a developer, but it's also a legal one. There are countries that have put in place laws to help ensure the web is developed in such a way to give everybody equal access. In America, there is the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, WCAG, which provide standards for making websites accessible.</p>
      <p>Web accessibility is not only beneficial to users, but also brings benefits to the developers in the form of a wider audience and reach. SEO is a big part of web accessibility. As a developer, you want people to use what you create; they can only do that if they can find it. Web accessibility makes it easier on the search engines to index information on a website, thereby making it easier to find.</p>
      <h3>Best Practices:</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Semantic HTML</dt>
        <dd>Applying appropriate HTML elements guarantees that screen readers will read the correct structure of the page.</dd>
        <dt>Keyboard Navigation
        <dt>
        <dd>The website should be navigational by keyboard for those people who can't operate the mouse.</dd>
        <dt>Alt Text for Images</dt>
        <dd>Providing alternate text allows a person with visual disability to know the content of the images.</dd>
        <dt>Color Contrast</dt>
        <dd>Proper color contrast makes the content readable for users having various types of visual impairments, due to color blindness.</dd>
        <dt>Responstive Design</dt>
        <dd>Making a website responsive and flexible ensure access to a range of user environments.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p><em>Our present physical world is highly dependent on our digital world. Web accessibility is an operational factor that makes our digital world more accessible and usable to every individual.</em></p>
