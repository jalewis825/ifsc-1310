        <h3>Campus Living</h3>
<p>UA Little Rock provides a variety of on-campus living options for students ranging from traditional resident rooms to multiple-bedroom apartments.

Six learning communities focusing on criminal justice, arts and culture, majors and careers, future business innovators, nursing careers, and STEM are available to students.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>UA Little Rock's <strong>14 athletic teams</strong> are known as the Little Rock Trojans, with almost all teams participating in the Sun Belt Conference. Little Rock is one of two Sun Belt members that do not sponsor football (UT Arlington being the other); UA Little Rock last fielded a football team in 1955 when it was known as Little Rock Junior College. Little Rock's main athletic offices are located in the Jack Stephens Center.</p>
<h5>UA Little Rock offers the following sports:</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Baseball</li>
    <li>Men's and Women's Basketball</li>
    <li>Men's and Women's Golf</li>
    <li>Women's Volleyball</li>
    <li>Women's Soccar</li>

</ol>
<p>Two Little Rock teams that do not compete in the Sun Belt are the women's swimming and diving team (Missouri Valley Conference) and wrestling (Pac-12 Conference), neither of which the Sun Belt sponsors. Wrestling is the school's newest sport, starting in 2019, and is the first Division I program in Arkansas.</p>
<p>Little Rock will move to the Ohio Valley Conference for the 2022-23 season.</p>
<p><q>We're excited about the talent we have assembled on this team brags Women's Basketball Head Coach, Steve Wiedower</q><q>We have a great core of returnees to go along with a talented group of newcomers. Every season, our expectation is to compete for the OVC championship and we are confident this team has what it takes to do so.</q></p>
